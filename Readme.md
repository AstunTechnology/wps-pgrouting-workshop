#Data Processing with WPS and PostGIS

Web Processing Services (WPS) can be a powerful addition to your web-based GIS, allowing you to add custom services such as routing algorithms or geo-processing tools. This workshop will introduce the three main open source WPS packages: [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org), [PyWPS](http://github.com/jachym/pywps-4) and [Zoo](http://www.zoo-project.org/). We will discuss their installation and the different approaches each take for the creation and configuration of services. During the workshop we will demonstrate the creation of a simple geo-processing service and allow participants to create their own. We will also demonstrate how to interact with a postgis database, and construct a simple shortest-path routing service using OpenStreetMap data and [pgRouting](http://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting). Finally, we will look at how to utilise these services, for example in a desktop GIS such as [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org).
