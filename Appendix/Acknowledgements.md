# Wrapping Up

Hopefully throughout this workshop you've gained an overview of how WPS works, and what the various WPS server packages are like. You've got an overview of how pgRouting works, and you've learnt how you can use both WPS and pgRouting within a desktop GIS such as QGIS. Finally how you might put these together in a web application.

You can continue to use the resources here with your copy of the OSGeo Live DVD- if you lose this then a new iso can be downloaded from the [live DVD website](http://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html).

This workshop will continue to be available at:
