## WPS PgRouting Workshop OSGIS 2014

Documentation for a workshop on Web processing Services and PgRouting, for OSGIS 2014 in Nottingham. 

# Overview

This workshop will try and provide an outline into what WPS Servers are, a brief overview of the three main open source packages, and their pros and cons.

We will try and build a simple "Hello World" service, and then explore a Polygon Buffer Service and a Shortest Path Routing service with PgRouting. 

Finally, we will explore different methods of connecting to the WPS server- via the QGIS WPS Plugin and through a simple web-based map.

Documentation built with GitBook.
